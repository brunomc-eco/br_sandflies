# Spatial distribution of leishmaniasis vectors in Brazil under climate change scenarios

R code used to analyse the spatial distribution of the main species of leishmaniasis vectors in Brazil.
A range of spatial analysis was used to explore and map the data, and ecological niche modelling was applied to predict the species' potential distribution under climate change scenarios.
